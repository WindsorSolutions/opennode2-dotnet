OpenNode2 for Java supports four database platforms:
- Oracle
- IBM DB2
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MySQL

.jar files are included for Oracle (ojdbc14_g.jar), DB2 (db2jcc.jar and db2jcc_license_cu.jar),
and MySQL (mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar).

Microsoft's licening terms prohibit us from bundling or re-distributing the drivers necessary 
for connecting to SQL Server. However, the sqljdbc.jar file can be freely downloaded from here:
