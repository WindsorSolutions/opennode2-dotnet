Opennode2 v1.17 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-08-05
================================================================================

This release primarily addresses interoperability issues the EN v2.0 Endpoint
(aka wne2.war). 

The .war files are drop-in replacements for an existing installation; if 
upgrading, be sure to back up the .properties files in each web application 
before deploying. See the Java Administration Guide for details.

Beginning with this release, plugin versions are synchronized with OpenNode2
itself. Due to changes in the Node, the minimum plugin version for this release
is also 1.17. (The gap in release numbers between 1.1.4 and 1.17 is an artifact
of synchronizing versions).
 
FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
* The EN v2.0 endpoint now correctly handles Query and Solicit requests.

* The EN v2.0 endpoint problem of  "null" fault messages has been fixed.

* Flow security (restricting user access to Data Exchanges) now works correctly.

* Bugs in the OpenNode2 Admin web application that appeared only when using IBM
  DB2 for the metadata database (including saving a datasource configuration) 
  have been addressed.

NEW
========================================
* The build scripts now handle version- and build-numbering in a more automated
  fashion.

Opennode2 v1.1.4 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-06-26
================================================================================

This release contains both new features and bug fixes. The .war files are drop-
in replacements for an existing installation; if upgrading, be sure to back up
the .properties files in each web application before deploying. See the Java
Administration Guide for details.

The minimum plugin versions for use with OpenNode1 v1.1.4 are:

AQS: 1.1.4
FRS: 1.1.4
NEI: 1.1.4
RCRA41: 1.1.6
SDWIS20: 1.1.4
WQX20: 1.1.5

NEW
========================================

* The binary release is compiled for Java 5; Java 1.4 is no longer supported.
  New source is fully Java 5 compliant, some existing source has been 
  refactored to take advantage of Java 5 language features.
  
* Because the binary plugins are also compiled for Java 5, you must upgrade 
  the OpenNode in order to use the new plugins.
  
* The binary distribution of the OpenNode and its plugins are still available in
  the download area of the OpenNode2 site on Google Code.
  
* The MapForceBridge plugin supports code generated by Altova MapForce - see the 
  "MapForce Plugin Developers Guide" for details.
  
* The nos.properties file in wnos.war/WEB-INF/classes now accepts a comma-
  delimited list of IP addresses as the value for the "ip.whitelist.subnet"
  property - there's no need to edit the nos.xml file to add additional
  addresses.

* This release includes Apache Velocity 1.6.2, upgraded from 1.5.  

* The ENDS2 plugin implements the GetServices method specified in the 
  "Exchange Network Discovery Services Flow Configuration Document", version
  2.0. (aka ENDS2 FCD). There is no separate plugin configuration guide, so 
  instructions are provided here.

  The ENDS2 plugin requires OpeNode2 v1.1 - it will not work on prior releases.

  To enable ENDS:
  
  1) Use Node Admin to create an Exchange named "ENDS_v20".

  2) Upload the Java Ends2 plugin to the ENDS_v20 Exchange.

  3) Create a new Service for the ENDS_V20 Exchange. Name it "GetServices", and 
      select the only option that appears on the "Implementor" drop-down list - 
      it should be 
      "com.windsor.node.plugin.ends2.ends3GetServicesQueryProcessor".

  4) Set the values in the nos.properties file in the deployed wnos web 
      application, as described in the following paragraphs, and restart the 
      Node. Several new properties have been added.
  
      These property names must be *present* in nos.properties in order for the
      Node to start up. Values may be left empty if not installing the ENDS 
      plugin, plugin, but MUST be set in order for the plugin to produce a valid
      response to a GetServices request to your Node. Sample values are provided 
      in the file in the binary distribution and the source repository.
  
      node.name: a short name for this Node

      node.deployment.type: one of "Development", "Test", or "Production"

      public.v2.endpoint.url: the URL other Nodes use to reach this Node's v2 
      endpoint. This is currently set to ${url.node.endpoint2} as a convenience.
      This value is set earlier in the nos.properties file, but may not be the
      same as the Node's externally-facing endpoint url if the Node is behind a
      firewall or proxy server.

      organization.identifier: short name of the organization hosting the node, 
      e.g., "NY Dept. of Environmental Conservation"
      
      bounding.coordinate.east
      bounding.coordinate.north
      bounding.coordinate.south
      bounding.coordinate.west
      
      Each of these is a decimal value indicating latitude (for North and South) 
      or longitude (for East and West), i.e., the coordinates that the define 
      bounding box for this Node's jurisdiction. See the ENDS2 FCD and XML 
      schema for details.

    
FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================

* Recurring schedules no longer run more than once per period, and the "next
  run date" should now display correctly in the Node Admin web application.
  
* A bug that in certain cases would lead to erroneous results of a 
  "GetStatus" call to another node has been fixed.
  
* The list of Exchanges in Node Admin is now alphabetized.

* The list of plugin implementation classes on the Node Admin "Edit Service"
  page no longer displays abstract implementation classes, thus avoiding an
  error when trying to save the Service.
