================================================================================
OpenNode2 v2.02 for Java - Release Notes                             2011-11-17
================================================================================
Release 2.02 enhances usability of the Java Node.
  
The Schedule Manager now prompts for implementer specific arguments when called 
for by a Plugin. Refer to individual Plugin Guides for definitions of plugin 
implementers and corresponding service and schedule parameters.
  
The Schedule Manager has added the ability to run a saved schedule from the 
schedule list screen.  This 'Run Now' button allows the user to run the schedule
without having to edit the schedule. 

'Get Status' and 'Download' functions are now available on the Node Transaction
Detail of the Activity Viewer.  "Get Status" will update the status of the 
transaction while the request is processing.  The "Download" button is an 
additional method to download the submitted document with the ability to save
locally.

When upgrading to version 2.02 it will be necessary to run an SQL update script.
Please refer to the Installation Guide for details.  In addition, OpenNode2 v2.02
contains numerous additional minor usability improvements and bug fixes.

================================================================================
OpenNode2 v2.00 for Java - Release Notes                             2011-05-2
================================================================================
This release complies with the new Endpoint 2.1 specification, accordingly the
new endpoint is now labeled v21 (previously v20).

With this version the Java Node now uses a new numbering scheme, versions of the 
Node will now use a 2.XX build numbering scheme, plugins will use a 2.XX.YY scheme
with YY signifying the plugin version and the XX signifying the lowest version of 
the Java Node with which it is compatible.  Accordingly, plugins with version 
numbers less than 2.00.00 will not work with this release.

The source code for this version has been rearranged to comply with the Maven 2
conventions for project organization.  With the Maven 2 pom.xml build files
getting up and running with the Node source should be easier than ever.  Please
note that anything in the Subversion repository's /trunk may be inherently unstable,
please use a tagged release under /tags as a base for your work.  All pom.xml files
contain XML comments with the most common Maven commands needed to use them.

The configuration for the Java Node is now greatly simplified, if upgrading please
refer to the Install Guide for details.

Additionally the Node Admin application can now test endpoints and database connections
as they are added.

================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.24 for Java - Release Notes                             2010-03-21
================================================================================
This release addresses a number of compatibility issues in the Node itself, 
especially the v.20 endpoint (aka wne2). It also contains an update to some
third-party libraries, and numerous small enhancements. 

Because of these changes in the Node, plugins with version numbers less than 
1.24 will not work with this release.

If installing this or a later version to run with a Node Administration database
used with an earlier release, please run the Nschedule_frequencytype_update.sql
script in database/fixes before starting the Node.

FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
  
* Configured wne2 so that the proper WSDL 1.1 is returned when calling 
  http<s>://<hostname>/wne2/services/v20?wsdl. This requires hard-coding the 
  protocol, host, and port in the wsdl file, which is now stored in 
  appropriate "Endpoint2/env/<build target>/v20.wsdl" and handled in the build. 
  See the comments near the bottom of the WSDL file for an example.

* In order to improve copmatibility with other Node implementations, wne2 was
  modified to use MTOM only on Submit and Download method calls, and to never set 
  headers in the SOAP envelope.
  
* Modified the built-in v20 client to never send the "SOAP-ACTION" HTTP header,
  and to never set headers in the SOAP envelope.  

* Refined CommonTransactionStatusCode and related classes to better handle 
  mixed case in status codes - a compatibility issue across Node implementations.
  
* Found and fixed a condition in which an "action=" attribute was added to the
  HTTP "content-type" header, thus breaking interoperability with certain ENN 
  v20 endpoint implementations.
  
* Refactored fault/exception handling in the built-in ENN v20 client, so it no 
  longer passed wne2-specific exception types back to wnos. (This would result 
  in a ClassNotFoundException in wnos, thus masking the original error message.)

NEW
========================================

* In Node Admin, linked names of items in lists (schedule.htm, flow.htm, etc.) 
  links (or HTML labels) so clicking the name is the same as clicking the green 
  "edit" icon.
  
* For Schedules, corrected the logic for setting the next run date, and made the 
  "Next run on: display in Node Admin more sensible (especially after selecting 
  "Save and run now".
  
* In the Schedule Editor, the "Save and run now" button is deactivated whenever
  the Schedule itself is deactivated.
  
* The Manage Schedules page now displays [Inactive] next to the Schedule's name
  when appropriate. 

* Upgraded Endpoint2 to Axis2 v1.5.1, in the hopes of getting it compatible with
  WebLogic 10.3.

* Minor updates to DDL for EIS and WQX plugins. 

================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.23 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-12-31
================================================================================
The purpose ofthis update is to address an issue in the WQX plugin.

FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
  
* In testing WQX at CDX, it became clear that, unlike other data exchanges, WQX
  submissions in which the filename ends in ".xml.zip" will be rejected by the 
  back-end Node; they will pass schema validation and produce a Validation
  Results file, but the staus will be "FAILED" and no Processing Report will be
  produced.
  
  The WQX plugin has been modified to generate zip files that end in ".zip"
  rather than ".xml.zip". 

================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.22 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-12-17
================================================================================
A quick bug-fix release.

FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
  
* The BEACHES plugin now handles <BeachSwimSeasonLengthDetail> elements, and the 
  DDL files have been corrected.
  
* A bugs in the build scripts that prevented nodeCommon.jar and nodeLogic.jar
  from properly updating in the Wnos_Plugin project has been addressed.
    
================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.21 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-12-16
================================================================================
This source release is accompanied by a binary release of the new EIS v.1.2, 
UIC v 1.0, and BEACHES v2.1 plugins, and updates to WQX, RCRA, and 
MapForceBridge plugins.

FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
  
* Fixed a bug in the RCRA plugin whereby the document header might not be 
  written, regardless of the configuration argument setting. Also cleaned up 
  namespace qualification problems in the Veolcity templates.
  
* Fixed a bug in the MapForceBridge plugin that prevented the plugin from 
  loading the supporting .jar file.

* In order to work around limitations in Microsoft Internet Security and
  Acceleration (ISA) Server 2006 when it's used as a proxy, both endpoints omit 
  sending the HTTP "ContentLength" header.

* Both endpoints can now accept self-signed SSL certificates without adding them
  to the local certificate store, and can accept expired certs as well. This
  "feature" is based on user demand for easy configuration in development and 
  test environments. 
  
  To revert to the default settings requires modifying HTTP transport settings 
  (commenting the current setting and un-commenting the originals) in these 
  files:
  
  - Endpoint/src/org/apache/axis/client client-config.wsdd (near line 10)
  - Endpoint2/resources/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml (near line 295)

NEW
========================================

Three new plugins! See their repsective Implementation Guides for installation
and configuration details.

* UIC10 

* EIS12 

* BEACHES21

* The WQX plugin now supports setting start and end dates for data extracted,
  as well as for ignoring the status and history of prior submissions. See the
  updated configuration guide for details.
  
* Updated the Oracle JDBC driver from ojdbc14_g.jar to ojdbc5_g.jar. This 
  version is fully compatible and recommended for running with JDK 5, and is
  also compatible with Oracle 11g.
   
* The windsor_checkstyle_rules.xml file has been converted to be compatible 
  with Checkstyle 5.0. Using this version in Eclipse requires removing the 
  eclipse-cs plugin for Checkstyle 4.0 and installing the version for Checkstyle
  5.0.
  
* Added jtds-1.2.4.jar to the source and binary distributions. JTDS is a free, 
  open source JDBC driver for MS SQL Server and Sybase, and a viable alternative 
  to Microsoft's own JDBC driver. It's distributed under the LGPL license. See 
  http://jtds.sourceforge.net/ for further details.

================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.20 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-10-30
================================================================================

This release introduces support for the ICIS-NPDES Discharge Monitoring Report
(DMR) Exchange, and support for recording SDWIS submissions in the HERE staging 
database. Binary distributions for each plugin are included. Both plugins will 
work with OpenNode2 v1.18 or later.

Changes to the source distribution includes new and modified configuration files
required for addressing unpredictable schedule behavior when running in a 
WebSphere cluster. If building from source, be sure to update your existing 
configuration files with new required propoerties.  

FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================

* In hard-to-reproduce circumstances, installing the OpenNode2 on a WebSphere 6.1
  cluster could result in schedules running in quick succession on each machine 
  in the cluster. In addition to enhancing transaction controlsd around schedule
  operations, the new worker.properties file enables forcing schedules to run on
  only one node in the cluster.
  
* Updated the seed script for DB2 to use Timestamp rather than Date.


NEW
========================================

* The ICIS-NPDES plugin supports the DMR exchange only. See the installation
  guide for setup details.
  
* The SDWIS plugin now has an implementation for recording SDWIS submissions to 
  the HERE Manifest records (SdwisSubmissionRelayProcessor). See the HERE 
  configuration guide for details. The original SimpleSdwisRequestProcessor is
  still included.

* Added declarative transaction control around ScheduleDao.getForNextExec(), to
  avoid multiple Nodes in a WebSphere cluster running the same schedule more or
  less simultaneously. This necessitated adding .jar files for AspectJ.
  
* Externalized the timing settings for the various worker tasks into 
  worker.properties, making it easier to customize the timings for differen build
  environments (e.g., dev, test, and production). 
  
* The scheduleWorkerTask.executionMachineName property in worker.properties is 
  empty by default. Setting to an unqualified hostname will limit shcedules to 
  running only on that host. Leaving it un-set (empty) allows schedules can run 
  on any machine in a cluster.  


================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.19 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-09-30
================================================================================

This release introduces the plugin that supports the Homeland Emergency Response
Exchange(HERE). This plugin is compatible with version 1.18 of the OpenNode. See
the associated installation and configuration guide for details.

This release  also features a number of small updates to the source code, but 
does not include a binary distribution.

FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
* Cleaned up minor issues related to schedules. If you build and install this
  version for use with an existing OpenNode2 Admin database, you'll need to run
  a simple update statement, provided in 
  Resources/database/fixes/fix_NSchedule_data.sql.

NEW
========================================
* Externalized worker thread startup delay and run intervals to new 
  worker.properties file, so they can be easily adjusted on a per-environment 
  basis.

* Added a per-minute option to the scheduler (mainly to facilitate testing)

================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.18 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-09-15
================================================================================

This release features new plugins, enhancements to support the Homeland 
Emergency Response Exchange (HERE), bug fixes, and additional refactoring for 
Java 5. The fixes and improvements in OpenNode2 itself require installing the
new OpenNode2 in order to use the plugins included in this release; the latest 
plugins may not function correctly with earlier OpenNode2 releases. See the 
updated installation guide for details. 

FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
* Fixed a bug introduced in the last release that sent transaction status codes
  in the wrong case.
  
* The EN v2.0 Endpoint (wne2.war) reliably reports the root error message for
  both incoming and outgoing service calls. 


NEW
========================================
* The RCRA41 plugin now includes support for the Compliance Monitoring & 
  Enforcement (CME) Module. See the new configuration guide foe details.

* For HERE users, this release introduces User Authorization Request management. 
  This requires installing the FlowSecurity plugin and configuring the relevant
  service. It also requires setting a new property named "manage.user.requests"
  in wna.war/WEB-INF/classes to "true" (it's set to "false" in this release), 
  so that the "Manage User Requests" button will appear in the Security tab of
  the OpenNode2 Admin application.  

* The "TASK" service type is introduced in  
  com.windsor.node.common.domain.ServiceType, to provide more robust 
  integration and audit capabilities for creating plugins to be run from 
  schedules only (and not callable via SOAP web services). The previous work-
  around (creating a plugin of ServiceType.NONE) was inelegant and did not 
  support configuration arguments.


================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.17 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-08-05
================================================================================

This release primarily addresses interoperability issues in the EN v2.0 Endpoint
(aka wne2.war). 

The .war files are drop-in replacements for an existing installation; if 
upgrading, be sure to back up the .properties files in each web application 
before deploying. See the Java Administration Guide for details.

Beginning with this release, plugin versions are synchronized with OpenNode2
itself. Due to changes in the Node, the minimum plugin version for this release
is also 1.17. (The gap in release numbers between 1.1.4 and 1.17 is an artifact
of synchronizing versions).
 
FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================
* The EN v2.0 endpoint now correctly handles Query and Solicit requests.

* The EN v2.0 endpoint problem of  "null" fault messages has been fixed.

* Flow security (restricting user access to Data Exchanges) now works correctly.

* Bugs in the OpenNode2 Admin web application that appeared only when using IBM
  DB2 for the metadata database (including saving a datasource configuration) 
  have been addressed.

NEW
========================================
* The build scripts now handle version- and build-numbering in a more automated
  fashion. 

================================================================================
OpenNode2 v1.1.4 for Java - Release Notes                             2009-06-26
================================================================================

This release contains both new features and bug fixes. The .war files are drop-
in replacements for an existing installation; if upgrading, be sure to back up
the .properties files in each web application before deploying. See the Java
Administration Guide for details.

The minimum plugin versions for use with OpenNode1 v1.1.4 are:

AQS: 1.1.4
FRS: 1.1.4
NEI: 1.1.4
RCRA41: 1.1.6
SDWIS20: 1.1.4
WQX20: 1.1.5

NEW
========================================

* The binary release is compiled for Java 5; Java 1.4 is no longer supported.
  New source is fully Java 5 compliant, some existing source has been 
  refactored to take advantage of Java 5 language features.
  
* Because the binary plugins are also compiled for Java 5, you must upgrade 
  the OpenNode in order to use the new plugins.
  
* The binary distribution of the OpenNode and its plugins are still available in
  the download area of the OpenNode2 site on Google Code.
  
* The MapForceBridge plugin supports code generated by Altova MapForce - see the 
  "MapForce Plugin Developers Guide" for details.
  
* The nos.properties file in wnos.war/WEB-INF/classes now accepts a comma-
  delimited list of IP addresses as the value for the "ip.whitelist.subnet"
  property - there's no need to edit the nos.xml file to add additional
  addresses.

* This release includes Apache Velocity 1.6.2, upgraded from 1.5.  

* The ENDS2 plugin implements the GetServices method specified in the 
  "Exchange Network Discovery Services Flow Configuration Document", version
  2.0. (aka ENDS2 FCD). There is no separate plugin configuration guide, so 
  instructions are provided here.

  The ENDS2 plugin requires OpeNode2 v1.1 - it will not work on prior releases.

  To enable ENDS:
  
  1) Use Node Admin to create an Exchange named "ENDS_v20".

  2) Upload the Java Ends2 plugin to the ENDS_v20 Exchange.

  3) Create a new Service for the ENDS_V20 Exchange. Name it "GetServices", and 
      select the only option that appears on the "Implementor" drop-down list - 
      it should be 
      "com.windsor.node.plugin.ends2.ends3GetServicesQueryProcessor".

  4) Set the values in the nos.properties file in the deployed wnos web 
      application, as described in the following paragraphs, and restart the 
      Node. Several new properties have been added.
  
      These property names must be *present* in nos.properties in order for the
      Node to start up. Values may be left empty if not installing the ENDS 
      plugin, plugin, but MUST be set in order for the plugin to produce a valid
      response to a GetServices request to your Node. Sample values are provided 
      in the file in the binary distribution and the source repository.
  
      node.name: a short name for this Node

      node.deployment.type: one of "Development", "Test", or "Production"

      public.v2.endpoint.url: the URL other Nodes use to reach this Node's v2 
      endpoint. This is currently set to ${url.node.endpoint2} as a convenience.
      This value is set earlier in the nos.properties file, but may not be the
      same as the Node's externally-facing endpoint url if the Node is behind a
      firewall or proxy server.

      organization.identifier: short name of the organization hosting the node, 
      e.g., "NY Dept. of Environmental Conservation"
      
      bounding.coordinate.east
      bounding.coordinate.north
      bounding.coordinate.south
      bounding.coordinate.west
      
      Each of these is a decimal value indicating latitude (for North and South) 
      or longitude (for East and West), i.e., the coordinates that the define 
      bounding box for this Node's jurisdiction. See the ENDS2 FCD and XML 
      schema for details.

    
FIXED/RESOLVED
========================================

* Recurring schedules no longer run more than once per period, and the "next
  run date" should now display correctly in the Node Admin web application.
  
* A bug that in certain cases would lead to erroneous results of a 
  "GetStatus" call to another node has been fixed.
  
* The list of Exchanges in Node Admin is now alphabetized.

* The list of plugin implementation classes on the Node Admin "Edit Service"
  page no longer displays abstract implementation classes, thus avoiding an
  error when trying to save the Service.
