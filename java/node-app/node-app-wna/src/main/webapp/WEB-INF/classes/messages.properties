# AUTH
authTitle=Welcome to the Node Admin
authIntroText=<p>Welcome to the Network Node Administration application or Node Admin!</p><p>The purpose of this application is to enable you to manage all aspects of the operation of your Network Node.</p><p>Please enter your NAAS user account and password to login to the Node Admin.</p>

# DASHBOARD
dashboardTitle=Dashboard
dashboardIntroText=<p>The Dashboard tab provides a brief summary of the key information concerning the status and operation of the Node. This information includes an illustration of the high volume transactions being executed against the Node, and the most active users of the Node.</p>

#DASHBOARD HEARTBEAT
dashboard.heartbeat.title=OpenNode2 Heartbeat
dashboard.heartbeat.details=These are your endpoints and their status.

# CONFIG
configTitle=Node Configuration Manager
configIntroText=<p>The Configuration tab allows you to manage certain key parameters which are used by the Node to support the operation of the data services provided by the Node.  It allows for these key parameters to be managed in only one single place even if the specific parameter is used by multiple data services.</p><p>Since the parameters that can be managed here will be used by many data services care should be taken when editing these values with caution as changes will have global impact.</p>

# CONFIG - ARGS
configArgsSectionTitle=Global Arguments
configArgsIntroText=<p>Global arguments are parameters that can be used to direct the operation of multiple data services.  For example, where a certain type of indicator or flag is used by multiple data services, a global value can be set for that indicator or flag and then simply referenced when the data services are defined to the Node.</p><p>This section allows you to create, modify and delete these global arguments.</p>

# CONFIG - CONN
configConnSectionTitle=Data Sources
configConnIntroText=<p>Data sources provide data services with the information needed to establish a connection to a particular database, or other type of data source, for the purpose of obtaining data to return to a requesting partner.  A single data source may provide the data to support multiple data services.</p><p>This section allows you to create, modify and delete these data sources.<p>

# CONFIG - PARTNER
configPartnerSectionTitle=Network Partners
configPartnerIntroText=<p>This section of the Node Configuration provides mechanism to define Exchange Network partners. Partners can be used in a schedule definition as the target recipient for data processes. Each partner can be defined as a TEST or PROD deployment which ensures the appropriate NAAS endpoint is used for authentication.</p><p>Network partner endpoint definitions provide data services with a target recipient for the results of XML document generation and other operations.  A single network partner definition, for example, the US EPA CDX Node, can be employed by many data services.</p><p>This section allows you to create, modify and delete these network partners.</p>

# SECURITY
secTitle=Security Manager
secIntroText=<p>The Security tab allows you to control and manage who is able to access your Node and to define what data services they are able to use by establishing security policies for accounts.</p>

# SECURITY - ACCOUNTS
secAccountSectionTitle=Account Manager
secAccountIntroText=<p>Anyone wishing to access the Node must obtain an account on the Network Authentication and Authorization Service (NAAS).  This section allows users with existing NAAS accounts to be granted access to the Node, and for new user accounts to be created on the NAAS and simultaneously be granted access to the Node.</p>

# SECURITY - ACCOUNTS NEW
secAccountNewSectionTitle=Account Manager
secAccountNewIntroText=<p>New user accounts will be created simultaneously for the Node and within NAAS. Once an account has been created, it can be assigned policies.</p><p>Please see the Node Admin User Guide for a detailed explanation of roles.</p><p>In the form below, existing NAAS account names will be suggested as you type.</p>

# SECURITY - ACCOUNTS EDIT
secAccountEditSectionTitle=Account Editor
secAccountEditIntroText=<p>User accounts will be managed simultaneously for the Node and within NAAS. A user account will be one of three types:</p><p>Please see the Node Admin User Guide for a detailed explanation of roles.</p>

# SECURITY - POLICY EDIT
secPolicyEditSectionTitle=Account Policy Manager
secPolicyEditIntroText=<p>Policies may be defined for each user account, and determine which data services the account holder may access.  Policies defined in this section will be created on the NAAS as well as the Node.</p> 
secPolicyEditProtectedInfo=<p>Indicates a protected flow. The checkbox is available if access to this flow requires a specific policy. Otherwise, only a valid, authenticated token is required.</p>

# SECURITY - MANAGE AUTH REQUESTS
secAuthReqMgrSectionTitle=Manage User Authorization Requests
secAuthReqMgrIntroText=<p>The User Authorization Request Manager allows you to manage pending user requests for access to protected flows on ths Node.</p>


# FLOW
flowTitle=Data Exchange Manager
flowIntroText=<p>The Data Exchange Manager allows you to create, modify and delete the data exchanges and associated data services that your Node supports.  Data Exchanges are typically characterized by a specific scope of data being shared by Exchange Network partners.</p><p>Each Data Exchange will include one or more Data Services, where those Data Services each provide a particular function within the scope of the parent Data Exchange.  Each Data Service is supported technically by an application Plugin which can be uploaded to the Node using the Data Exchange Manager.</p>

# FLOW LIST
flowListSectionTitle=Data Exchanges
flowListSectionIntroText=<p>This section allows you to create, modify, or delete Data Exchanges. You must define a Data Exchange before you will be able to upload a Plugin for that Data Exchange or create Data Services.</p>

# FLOW DETAIL
flowItemSectionTitle=Manage Data Exchange
flowItemSectionIntroText=<p>This page allows you to configure or add new data flows. You must define a data flow before you will be able to create a data service for that flow.</p>
flowItemDefaultSecurityText=Setting default flow security will require a specific policy for all flow related requests (Query, Solicit, Download etc.); Additionally any services belonging to this Flow marked "No Auth Required", will still require Authorization.

# FLOW SERVICE DETAIL
flowServiceSectionTitle=Manage Exchange Service 
flowServiceSectionIntroText=<p>This screen allows you to configure or add new services for a selected flow.  For examples, the service "GetFacilityByChangeDate" will return all facilities for a given state code and change date.</p>

# FLOW PLUGIN UPLOAD
flowListPluginSectionTitle=Upload Plugins 
flowListPluginSectionIntroText=<p>This section allows you to upload a new Plugin which will provide new Data Services for use in the Node. The uploaded Plugin file must be compressed.</p>

# SCHEDULE
scheduleTitle=Schedule Manager
scheduleIntroText=<p>The Schedule Manager allows you to create, modify and delete certain types of regularly occurring processes that the Node itself should initiate.  These differ from the external requests that require a response from the Node.</p>

# SCHEDULE LIST
